\chapter{Object Detection}
\label{cha:intro}
\section{My Application}
(1)Download youtube Videos via "pytube"\\
(2)Use "ffmpeg" to make 10-FPS videos\\
	(a)This step can reduce frames of whole videos\\
(3)Extract video frames from the 10-FPS videos\\
(4)Annotate video frames by image labelling tools "RectLabel"\\
(5)Convert VOC format into YoLo format via "RectLabel"\\
(6)
\section{Object Detection Pre-Train techniques}


\section{Object Detection Trainning techniques}
Q1:Ad hoc training\\
Q2:How to Classify regions with SVMs\\
Q3:The use of FC layer\\
Q4:The use of Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer\\
Q5: What is Linear + softmax\\
Q6:Region of Interest (RoI) pooling must be (sub') 
differentiable to train conv layers\\
Q7:What can be efficient SGD steps\\
Q8:What is region'wise sampling\\
Q9:What is mini batches\\
Q10:Why is hierarchical sampling help build mini
batches\\
Q11:How Fast-RCNN solve out of region problem?
\section{Object-oriented state Abstraction in RL for Video Games}
\textbf{Reduce state space size}\\
(1)known coordinates of objects in K classes and demonstrate $\phi :S\mapsto \{0,1\} ^{\{L\times L\times X\}}$\\
(2)divide image s into grid $L\times L$, then represent the K classes by K matrices of size $L\times L$\\
\textbf{Automatic Object Detection}\\
(1) Randomly propose bounding boxes\\
(2)Autoencoder\\
(3)k-means\\
(4)new abstraction $\phi$\\
(5)learn abstracted Q-function\\
(6)collect new experience states and\\
(7)update centroids and filter out irrelevant objects\\
\textbf{Filter out irrelevant objets by updating centroids}\\
Use k-mean and threshold\\
Threshold is determined by a rule of thumb based on t-test for Q values
\textbf{Summary}\\
Q1:Why should the K in k-means be greater than object classes?\\
Q2:Why is it a lower dimensional space\\
Q3:What is the advantages of using k-means\\
Q4:What is the disadvantages of using k-means\\
Q5:Why do we use the Q-function on object detection\\
Q6:What is the "a rule of thumb based on t-test"\\
\textbf{Results of this paper}\\

\section{YOLO}
\textbf{Summary}\\
Q1: What is "num"? What is "anchor"? Why is filter calculated by: num/3 * (class + 5)?\\
A1:In yolov3, num = 9
Q2: What is weight of a net? What is it for?\\

\section{CenterNet: Keypoint Triplets for Object Detection $\&$ Objects as Points}
\textbf{Summary}\\
Q1:What drawbacks of CornerNet the CenterNet improved? by what?\\
