\label{cha:intro}
\section{My Application}
(1)Get folders' locations\\
(2)Get/check output folder's name and location\\
(3)Get normalise settings\\
(4)Normalise images and save results with ordered names in specific folder\\
(5)
\section{Object-oriented state Abstraction in RL for Video Games}
\textbf{Reduce state space size}\\
(1)known coordinates of objects in K classes and demonstrate $\phi :S\mapsto \{0,1\} ^{\{L\times L\times X\}}$\\
(2)divide image s into grid $L\times L$, then represent the K classes by K matrices of size $L\times L$\\
\textbf{Automatic Object Detection}\\
(1) Randomly propose bounding boxes\\
(2)Autoencoder\\
(3)k-means\\
(4)new abstraction $\phi$\\
(5)learn abstracted Q-function\\
(6)collect new experience states and\\
(7)update centroids and filter out irrelevant objects\\
\textbf{Filter out irrelevant objets by updating centroids}\\
Use k-mean and threshold\\
Threshold is determined by a rule of thumb based on t-test for Q values
\textbf{Summary}\\
Q1:Why should the K in k-means be greater than object classes?\\
Q2:Why is it a lower dimensional space\\
Q3:What is the advantages of using k-means\\
Q4:What is the disadvantages of using k-means\\
Q5:Why do we use the Q-function on object detection\\
Q6:What is the "a rule of thumb based on t-test"\\
\textbf{Results of this paper}\\

\textbf{Summary}\\
Q1:What drawbacks of CornerNet the CenterNet improved? by what?\\
